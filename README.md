# Bol.com Stock Scraper

This project is a TypeScript-based asynchronous scraper that queried Bol.com for product stock information using unofficial endpoints. It leverages `modern-async` and `got` for concurrent HTTP requests and uses PostgreSQL for persistence. Proxy rotation was implemented to mitigate IP bans.

## Purpose

This repository is a technical showcase and is no longer functional due to increased defensive measures by Bol.com. It is not maintained, and no support will be provided.

## Notes

- Originally designed to query product availability at scale.
- Uses PostgreSQL for tracking scraped data.
- Implemented proxy support and request throttling.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided for educational and demonstrative purposes only. Do not use it to interact with Bol.com's services.
